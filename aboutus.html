                <h3>Lee Ann Qi</h3>
                <p class="role">Web Developer</p>
                <p>My name is Lee Ann Qi, though I usually go by Angie. I am half-Malaysian, half-Vietnamese and recently came to Vietnam 2 years ago with my family. Currently, I am majoring in Digital Marketing, however I took this course as my general elective because of my interest in learning new skills and also because it is good to at least have a little IT background, seeing that technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. My hobbies include reading, listening to music and cafe hopping with my friends. I have always been interested in emerging technologies and how they could change the world and the way we live.

                <p class="role">Product Designer</p>
                <p>My name is Nguyen Huu Minh Khang and I am in charge of designing the product in this project. I am an inspiring student who wishes to master machine learning and artificial intelligence. This product is a demonstration of how machine learning can improve our lives in many ways that we have not imagined yet. As a beginner in the technology industry, I can bring fresh views, perspectives to the table and will implement them with my skills later on. I'm excited to explore, learn more about the fascinating world of IT.</p>

                <h3>Nguyen Ba Khoi</h3>
                <p class="role">Prototype Developer</p>
                <p>My name is Nguyen Ba Khoi, and I am a Vietnamese and was born in Ho Chi Minh city, however , I was raised in Binh Duong province and still live there to this day. I chose this major because the potential of technology affecting the world is huge despite it already having a powerful impact on today’s world. I want to be part of the technology community and bring technology to a higher level and reach places where we haven’t found. My hobbies right now are just hanging out with my friends and talking about anything that catches our interest, and training myself in any aspect as I want to see the best version of myself.</p>
